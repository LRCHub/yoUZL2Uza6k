[00:00.29] I can't be satisfied such things
[00:08.78] I wanna stack up higher than you did, oh
[00:17.11] If you want to create do break a real thing
[00:24.76] Let's break everything anyway
[00:41.24] I can't be satisfied such things
[00:45.11] I wanna stack up higher than you did
[00:50.31] If you want to create do break a real thing
[00:54.66] Let's break everything anyway
[01:16.03] Hey, here why don't you ruin
[01:19.60] Everything you have been stacking enough little by little
[01:24.43] The decision might piss you off
[01:28.27] But you know distraction gives us drastic creation
[01:32.98] Break everything (break everything) break everything (break everything)
[01:37.10] And get start over again
[01:41.74] Break everything (break everything)
[01:43.75] And get start over again
[01:46.69] I can't be satisfied such things
[01:52.35] I wanna stack up higher than you did
[01:57.58] If you want to create do break a real thing
[02:02.41] Let's break everything anyway
[02:07.46] You go and pick up what has gone away
[02:10.75] I am here, stand up as many times as it will take and I won't stop
[02:16.37] Let's break everything anyway
